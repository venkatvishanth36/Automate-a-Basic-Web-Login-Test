# ðŸš€ adding_thread_sleep_slowdown

This is a simple Selenium automation script written in Java that demonstrates how to automate a basic login form on [Practice Test Automation](https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/) using `Thread.sleep()` to intentionally slow down each step of the process for visibility and debugging purposes.

## ðŸ“‹ What It Does

- Opens Chrome and navigates to the login page.
- Enters a username and password.
- Clicks the login button.
- Validates whether the login was successful.
- Uses `Thread.sleep()` after each major step to simulate slower execution for observation.
